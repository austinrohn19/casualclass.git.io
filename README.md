# Casual Class

As an avid hobbyist, I want an app that allows me to watch videos to learn new skills, as well as post my own videos to teach others, so that I can pick up new hobbies easily and potentially make money by posting videos that teach other users.

The pandemic affected everyone globally in many different ways. During lockdowns, people generally had a lot of time to themselves and dove into new hobbies to pass the time. Our goal was to create one place where someone could learn the skills for a new hobby and/or create their own video content that teaches others.
